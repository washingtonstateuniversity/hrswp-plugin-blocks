3. Select Plugins > Add New and then select the "Upload Plugin" button.
4. Select "Browse" and locate the downloaded .zip file for the plugin (it **must** be a file in .zip format) on your computer. Select "Install Now."

## For Developers

The HRSWP Blocks plugin development environment relies primarily on NPM and Composer. The `package.json` and `composer.json` configuration files manage necessary dependencies for testing and building the production version of the theme. The NPM scripts in `package.json` do most of the heavy lifting.

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the HRSWP Blocks plugin to a directory on your computer.
2. Change into that directory.
3. Install the NPM and Composer dependencies.
4. Ensure linting and coding standards checks are working -- this should exit with zero (0) errors.
5. Create a new branch for local development.

In a terminal:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity/hrswp-plugin-blocks.git hrswp-plugin-blocks
cd hrswp-plugin-blocks
npm install; composer install
npm test -s
git checkout -b new-branch-name
~~~

### Build Commands
